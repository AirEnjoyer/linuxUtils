Make sure to have the glad folder in ~/. If you dont have it, just look up "glad openGL", you'll find it.
Usage: sdltemplate projectName
the executable will be named projectName, so if you do 
sdltemplate helloWorld
the executable (when compiled) will be called helloWorld.
To install system wide, run "sudo cp sdltemplate /usr/local/bin/"
Obviously make sure to have sdl and openGL installed.
